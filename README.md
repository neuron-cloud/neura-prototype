# Synapse v3.0: Advanced Clinical Risk Intelligence Platform

Synapse is an intelligent NLP-based decision support engine designed to parse unstructured clinical text and extract high-risk neurological exam findings in real-time. Built from the ground up for neurosurgical consults, Synapse identifies subtle red flags‚Äîincluding motor weakness patterns, altered mental status, pathological reflexes, sensory deficits, cauda equina features, stroke indicators, and spine instability‚Äîwith human-like nuance and contextual reasoning.

## üéØ Purpose

Synapse was born from the gaps in real-world clinical decision-making, especially in high-stakes, high-fatigue environments like neurosurgery. It doesn't replace judgment. It enhances it.

- Surface cognitive biases and risk signals that might be overlooked
- Flag critical findings from clinical vignettes with confidence scoring
- Provide standardized clinical scores with evidence-based recommendations
- Enhance clinical decision-making through systematic pattern recognition

## üîß Use Cases

- **EMR Decision Support** - Integrated clinical alerts and flags
- **Quality Assurance** - Systematic review of clinical documentation
