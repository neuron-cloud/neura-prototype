# NEURA: Clinical Decision Reflection Prototype

NEURA is a prototype AI tool designed to support real-time clinical decision-making through structured analysis of unstructured patient consult blurbs.

## Core Goals:
- Identify cognitive biases and red flags
- Surface high-risk findings from consult notes
- Prompt structured reflection before irreversible decisions

This repository contains the first version of NEURAâ€™s clinical parser and signal flagger.

More modules coming soon.
